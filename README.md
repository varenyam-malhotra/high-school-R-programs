## Data Analytics
This program reads in a csv of some messy, unsorted, uncleaned data. The code cleans up the numerical and missing data through several mathematical operations using the mean of available numbers. Uses several R libraries such as plotluck, lubridate, and tidyverse. Performs rank-z transforms and creates several plots and data visualizations.
