# High School R Programs

The following modules are available in this repository

## Data Analytics
This program reads in a csv of some messy, unsorted, uncleaned data. The code cleans up the numerical and missing data through several mathematical operations using the mean of available numbers. Uses several R libraries such as plotluck, lubridate, and tidyverse. Performs rank-z transforms and creates several plots and data visualizations. 

## Malhotra AQ Script
Analyzes air quality data by creating plots to analyze several relationships between different variable of the data. Includes performing multiple linear regressions, saving data in matrices, and obtaining the BIC number (Bayesian information criterion). 

## Malhotra Cars PCA Script
Performs a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on car data including filtering data, calculating PCAs based on variances and standard deviations, creating new dataframes, and using the ggplot2 library. 

## Malhotra Star
Analyzes star data from the European Space Agency and analyzing characteristics such as the visual magnitude, parallax, and proper motion in right acsension and declination using tools such as matrices, data filtering, visualization, and plotting.
