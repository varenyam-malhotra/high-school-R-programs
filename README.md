# High School R Programs

The following modules are available in this repository

## Data Analytics
This program reads in a csv of some messy, unsorted, uncleaned data. The code cleans up the numerical and missing data through several mathematical operations using the mean of available numbers. Uses several R libraries such as plotluck, lubridate, and tidyverse. Performs rank-z transforms and creates several plots and data visualizations. 

## Malhotra AQ Script
Analyzes air quality data by creating plots to analyze several relationships between different variable of the data. Includes performing multiple linear regressions, saving data in matrices, and obtaining the BIC number (Bayesian information criterion). 

## Malhotra Cars PCA Script
Performs a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on car data including filtering data, calculating PCAs based on variances and standard deviations, creating new dataframes, and using the ggplot2 library. 

## Malhotra Star
Analyzes star data from the European Space Agency and analyzing characteristics such as the visual magnitude, parallax, and proper motion in right acsension and declination using tools such as matrices, data filtering, visualization, and plotting.

## Malhotra Sugiyama
Analyzes genetic QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus) data using several different functions to obtain and understand the genotypes, phenotypes, and genetic markers. Finds locations in the genome for the specific genes that code for Blood Pressure, Resting Heart Rate, Heart Weight, and more. Utilized LOD scores and recombination fractions to figure out whether two genes are linked or not due to being in similar chromosome location. For each gene I calculated a genetic probability map, performed mainscans, and calculated Bayesian Probability Confidence Intervals to help come to conclusions and fully analyze the locations, relationships, and plots of each phenotype and genotype. 

## Malhotra Sugiyama2 Lab
Expanded on the MalhotraSugiyama file and analyzed a different Sugiyama dataset of QTL data.
